        "Charles Bukowski was an alchoholic, a womanizer, a chronic gambler, a lout, a cheapskate, a deadbeat, and on his worst days, a poet. He's probably the last person on earth you would ever look to for life advice or expect to see in any sort of self-help book. Which is why he's the perfect place to start."
      </div>
      <div class="second-paragraph">
        "Bukowski wanted to be a writer. But for decades his work was rejected by almost every magazine, newspaper, journal, agent, and publisher he submitted to. His work was horrible, they said. Crude. Disgusting. Depraved. And as the stacks of rejection slips piled up, the weight of his failures pushed him deep into an alcohol-fueled depression that would follow him for most of his life. Bukowski had a day job as a letter-filer at a post office. He got paid shit money and spent most of it on booze. he gambled away the rest at the racetrack. At night, he would drink alone and sometimes hammer out poetry on his beat-up old typewriter. Often, he'd wake up on the floor, having passed out the night before."
      </div>
      <div>
        Thirty years went by like this, most of it a meaningless blur of alcohol, drugs, gambling, and prostitues. Then, when Bukowski was fifty, after a lifetime of failure and self-loathing, an editor at a small independent publishing house took a strange interest in him. The editor couldn't offer Bukowski much money or a promise of sales. But he had a weird affection for the drunk loser, so he decided to take a chance on him.It was the first real shot Bukowski had every gotten, and, he realized, probably the only one he would ever get. Bukowski wrote back to the editor: "I have one of two choices- stay in the post office and go crazy... or stay out here and play at writer and starve. I have decided to starve.""
        </div>
        <div>
        "Upon signing the contract, Bukowski wrote his first novel in three weeks. It was called simply Post Office. In the dedication, he wrote, "Dedicated to nobody." Bukowski would make it as a novelist and poet. He would go on and publish six novels and hundreds of poems, selling over two million copies of his books. His popularity defied everyone's expectations, particularly his own."
        </div>
        <div>
          "Stories like Bukowski's are the bread and butter of our cultural narrative. Bukowski's life embodies the American Dream: a man fights for what he wants, never gives up, and eventually achieves his wildest dreams. It's practically a movie waiting to happen. We all look at stories like Bukowski's and say, "See? He never gave up. He never stopped trying. He always believed in himself. He persisted against all the odds and made something of himself!" It is then strange that on Bukowski's tombstone, the epitaph reads:"Don't try" See, despite the book sales and the fame, Bukowski was a loser. He knew it. And his success stemmed not from some determination to be a winner, but from the fact that he knew he was a loser, accepted it, and then wrote honestly about it. He never tried to be anything other than what he was. The genus in Bukowski's work was not in overcoming unbelievable odds or developing himself into a shining literary light. It was the opposite. It was his simple ability to be completely, unflinchingly honest with himself-especially the worst parts of himself- and to share his failings without hesitation or doubt."
          </div>
          <div>
            "This is a real story of Bukowski's success: his comfort with himself as a failure. Bukowski didn't give a f*** about success. Even after his fame, he still showed up to poetry readings hammered and verbally abused people in his audience. He still exposed himself in public and tried to sleep withe every woman he could find. Fame and success didn't make him bette. Nor was it by becoming a better person that he became famous and successful."
