On a main document you can have as many head and body as long as they are all properly closed. The head contains brief important information and is designed to be the header of the document. Where as the body contains the facts and content of the webpage.
A structural markup is what gives information about the structure of the document. Where as a Semantic markup is a way of structuring the HTML to reinforces the content.
I think my biggest struggle this week was comprehending how to use a semantic markup. I over came this by watching a few videos I found online as well as following you example given on github. The one enjoyable thing about modern day and the internet is there is a video for anything you possibly could be struggling with. I find this extremely helpful for online learning environments.
