Did you learn anything new about web development?:
MY GOSH did I learn anything. I came into this class with literally ZERO knowledge. Throughout the course I learned a plethora of information. From how a website really works and functions to some really interesting codes.
Did you learn anything new about web design:
My answer here is very similar to my thoughts on the above question. I think this course was one of my most interesting and intellectual courses yet.
Challenges:
Learning web development and web design was really like learning a foreign language to me. I had to really dive in and try to understand the concepts. I found my self like a deer in the head lights more than I would like to admit. But once it clicks and it's like you can speak the language fluently.

Thank you for everything this semester your class was such a pleasure to take. I hope to take another in the near future as well!
