      I was born in Vancouver, Washington, but I consider myself a native Montanan as my parents moved me here when I was 2. I grew up in the small town of Stevensville, Montana where I learned to love everything about the outdoors. From hiking to skiing or even just walking around Missoula. I thrive to be outdoor.

      I started my education journey at Lone Rock Middle School. Probably one of the smallest middle schools ever. We had about 10-15 people in each of our classes. Later I journeyed to Stevensville Highschool, which by no means was bigger, but had a lot more students and space. Throughout my time at Stevensville highschool I actively was involved in Track, Cross-country, Soccer, Student Council, and Key Club. There is no doubt I have to keep my self busy.

      After graduating from highschool in 2018 I decided to continue my journey up to the University of Montana. Here I was all over on what I wanted to do. Some days I thought about being a nurse and others I wanted to drop out and become a hairstylist. Long be-hold I ended up being passionate about marketing and here I am.

      I thought that coming into college I would slow down and take a bit off my plate. Little did I know I would just add more to my plate. I started my freshman year of college being a full-time barista at Florence Coffee Co. from here I decided that mornings really suck. That being said my sophomore year I decided to make a switch and start working an internship with TWO MEN AND A TRUCK. I also worked part time at Romeos Italian kitchen for some extra hours.

     During the Spring semester of my Junior year I decided I needed MORE to do and crazily added a part time job being a ski instructor with Discovery ski Area. I felt like the world was caving in on me I was SO busy. But even admist all the busyiness I fell in love with this job. When the snow melted and the season ended I felt so lost. I can not wait to get back up there next year. I enjoy to be SUPER active and engaged in the community and I can not wait to see what my future holds.
