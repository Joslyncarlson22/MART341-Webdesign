      Rob Hall the lead climber on the life changing trip to Mount Everest,
      the tallest summit in the world. This journey follows a group of hikers
      attemping to reach the summit. The climb is structured into different
      base camps. Base camp,camp 1,camp 2,camp 3, and camp 4 all leading closer
      to the summit. The group spends roughly 4 weeks at base camp and then
      begins the hike to summit.

      Throughout the trek John Krakauer discusses the details of the journey.
      The difficulties they face and the challenges many climbers face at such
      high altitude. Throuhgout many mishaps the first death of the journey
      takes place. From this point on the climbers are prepared that death
      is something to be familar with for the rest of the trek.

        Finally after weeks attempting to summit they arrive to the final trek.
        This is where everything starts to fall apart. It was just barely the
        right conditions to summit and lead climber had made it clear all
        climbers must summit before 2:00 pm. Members of Robs group did not
        summit until 4:00 pm the turn around time was not enforced. Arriving
        at the top with another climbing group.

        As mentioned earlier the conditons were not ideal to be summiting and
        the climbers encounter a storm. One climber makes it to camp four well
        ahead of the others, while two get stranded in the storm. This storm
        was the ending to most of the climbers journey on Everest. Where a total
        of eight climbers did not successfuly return to base.

          Krakauers intentions of the book were to discuss struggles and how
          life changing this event was. He hoped to address questions about events
          and provide answers to loved ones. He did reach out after the book
          to apologize about any pain or anger the book may have caused. In
          the recent years the book was also created into a movie titled 'Everest'
