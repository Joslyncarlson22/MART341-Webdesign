Describe any forms you've come across while browsing the web. What purposes do they serve? : I often find my self running into forms on website that I am shopping on. Generally they are for subscribing to the product or company. In general they serve a great purpose to collect information easily.
List examples of text, selection, and button input, and their usage.:
Examples:
Text ( Plain, Password, text area, maxlength, placeholder)
Selection (Selection, Radio, The Checkbox, Select Box)
Button (Upload, Submit, Image, Button)
The usage of these are to allow users to input information to the site with a simple click. It allows for all the 'action' to happen on one page. 
Free response: This week I struggled with my body on my index.html for some reason it seems to not be inputting correctly into my site and kept continuing to appear at the top. I never did solve this problem either so please let me know if you see my issue! I also struggled with my logo being not the best quality for putting into a page.
