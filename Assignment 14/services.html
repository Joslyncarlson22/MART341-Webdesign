      Looking to store or already have some items in storage that you need to move? Couldn’t find a place for a few extra toys, decorations, or pieces of furniture in your new home? We’d be happy to move your items to and from a storage facility of your choice.
    </p>

    <p>
      We value our senior community in Missoula and practice THE GRANDMA RULE® so that all of our customers are treated just like we would want our grandmas to be treated – with patience, personal care, and respect. We’ll lend a helping hand to our seniors as they downsize and transition to a smaller home or another apartment, move to a retirement community or assisted living, or perhaps just need help to rearrange existing furniture in their current homes.
    </p>

    <p>
      With the Carry Crew service, you get move help from our professionally-trained, background checked, and drug tested moving teams. They handle your items with care while loading or unloading the rental truck or container you’ve arranged.

This is move help by the hour, and our moving teams can move as much or as little as you’d like – we’re here to help you!
    </p>
Our team of dedicated professionals are happy to help move the heavy items such as pianos,  gun safes, china cabinets, and sectionals to another floor of your home. Need the garage cleaned out or the patio furniture moved? We can also move mattresses and appliances or pick them up and deliver them from the store directly to your doorstep, into the house, and handle any assembly needed.  We are also able to provide service to assist with furniture rearrangement for spring or fall cleaning and renovation projects.
